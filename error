ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  mapping values are not allowed in this context

The error appears to be in '/root/python-automotion/gather_info.yml': line 6, column 48, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    - name: Get CPU model
      shell: lscpu | grep 'Model name' | awk -F: '{print $2}' | xargs
                                               ^ here
